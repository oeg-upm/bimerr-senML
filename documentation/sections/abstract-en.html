<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Sensor Data ontology has been developed to represent measurements generated by sensors located inside building spaces. It also includes specific concepts and properties to model sensors and actuators records that follow the SenML standard. This model allows the representation of resolved and unresolved records if required. (Check SenML standard for more details: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8428#)</span>
